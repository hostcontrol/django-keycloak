Setup for local user storage
============================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 4

By local user storage a
`User object <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/auth/default/#user-objects>`_
get created for every logged in identity. This can be handy when you want to
link objects to this User. If that's not the case please read the
scenario :ref:`remote_user_setup`.

Since **this is the default behaviour for Django Keycloak** you don't have to
configure any setting.

Important to point out the `KEYCLOAK_OIDC_PROFILE_MODEL` setting. This should
contain `django_keycloak.RemoteUserOpenIdConnectProfile` (which is the case by default).
The model to store the Open ID Connect profile is a swappable model. When
configured to this model a foreign key to the configured Django User model is
available.

.. code-block:: python

    # settings.py
    KEYCLOAK_OIDC_PROFILE_MODEL = 'django_keycloak.RemoteUserOpenIdConnectProfile'
